# Protocols

## What&apos;s a protocol?

A protocol is a set procedure to carry out / partake in some communication / an activity. In an abstract sense, it's like saying "Hi" back to someone who greets you.

Likewise, for computers (and especially those connected to other devices) - a protocol is a set of rules dictating how devices communicate with each other.

## Internet Standards

The protocols for transmitting data over a network are collectively known as "Internet Standards"

- **RFC**: Request For Comments
- **IETF**: Internet Engineering Task Force

These protocols dictate how devices communicate with each other, and the structure of the packets that they utilise
