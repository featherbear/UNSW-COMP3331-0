# Transport Layer

## TCP Protocol

- reliable transport
- flow control
- congestion control (slows down the sender then network is busy)
- Does not provide timing, minimum throughput guarantee or security
- connection oriented (setup is required between client and server)

## UDP Protocol

- unreliable data transfer
- does not provide flow control, congestion control, timing, throughput guarantee security or connection setup
